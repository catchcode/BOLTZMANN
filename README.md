ISING: SOLVING ISING CHAIN MODEL

ISING_SR: SOLVING ISING CHAIN MODEL USING STOCHASTIC RECONFIGURATION.

Heisenberg 1D: SOLVING HEISENBERG CHAIN MODEL

Heisenberg 2D: SOLVING HEISENBERG SQUARE LATTICE MODEL

ED : Exact diagonalization CODES TO COMPARE THE RESULTS OF BOLTZMANN MACHINE.

     TO COMPILE, INSTALL LAPACK, and GIVES -llapack option.
          
          ISING_ED CODES, MAGNETIC FIELD IS INPUT.
          
          FOR HEISENBERG MODEL, J=1 IS SET IN THE CODE. (SPIN = 1/2)
          
* RBM_2SET : MAGNITUEDS AND PHASES ARE TREATED SEPARATELY. 
   
             THIS INCLUDES THE RESULT OF Heisenberg 1D CHAIN 
             
             IT TAKES LONG TIME TO CONVERGE. IT HARDLY CONVERGES EVER.
       
 
* TE : TIME EVOLUTION OF MANYBODY WAVEFUNCTION USING RBM.
