# BOLTZMANN
boltzmann-machine Many body 

ISING: SOLVING ISING CHAIN MODEL

ISING_SR: SOLVING ISING CHAIN MODEL USING STOCHASTIC RECONFIGURATION.

Heisenberg 1D: SOLVING HEISENBERG CHAIN MODEL

Heisenberg 2D: SOLVING HEISENBERG SQUARE LATTICE MODEL

ED : Exact diagonalization CODES TO COMPARE THE RESULTS OF BOLTZMANN MACHINE.

     TO COMPILE, INSTALL LAPACK, USE -llapack option for compile.
          
     ISING_ED CODES HAS MAGNETIC FIELD AS INPUT.
          
     FOR HEISENBERG MODEL, J=1 IS SET IN THE CODE. (SPIN = 1/2)
          
RBM_2SET : MAGNITUEDS AND PHASES ARE TREATED SEPARATELY. 
           THIS INCLUDES THE RESULT OF HEISENBERG 1D CHAIN. 
           GENERALLY, IT TAKES LONG TIME TO CONVERGE. 
       
TE : TIME EVOLUTION OF MANYBODY WAVEFUNCTION USING RBM.
